**Project Features: Image Processing Engine MVP (Azure Integrated)**

---

## 🚀 Core MVP Features (Implemented in 15-Day Plan)

### 🖼️ Basic Image Operations

* Resize (fixed size, aspect ratio, thumbnails)
* Crop, Rotate (degrees), Flip (horizontal, vertical)
* Format conversion (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
* File I/O: Load, Save, Safe output paths

### 🎨 Image Filters

* Grayscale, Sepia, Black & White threshold
* Invert colors
* Brightness, Contrast, Saturation adjustments

### 🔍 Effects

* Gaussian Blur
* Sharpen
* Emboss
* Edge Detection (Sobel)

### 🖋️ Watermarking

* Text Watermark (font, color, opacity, position)
* Image Watermark (logo overlay, opacity, scale)

### 📋 Metadata

* Read EXIF metadata (dimensions, DPI, orientation)
* Format details and compression metadata

### ⚙️ Utilities

* File helper (safe rename, extension checks)
* Logging with timestamp
* Retry helper for transient failures
* Stopwatch performance tracking

### 🧵 Parallelism

* Parallel.ForEach processing
* Async Task.Run and ThreadPool variants
* Batch queue execution engine

---

## ☁️ Azure Cloud Integration

* Upload/download images via Azure Blob Storage
* Job queue using Azure Queue Storage or Service Bus
* Job model: batch instructions via JSON
* Configurable processors triggered from queue
* Option for Azure Function integration (post-MVP)

### 🔒 Security & Config

* Secret config using Azure Key Vault or local config
* Token-based or IP-limited API access

### 📈 Observability

* Logs per image (input size, output size, ops run)
* Duration tracking
* Telemetry via Serilog or Application Insights

## ✨ Planned Post-MVP Features

* Format support: WebP, AVIF, HEIF
* Image comparison / perceptual hashing (dedup)
* Template-based watermarking (batch branding)
* Pipeline execution via JSON/YAML configs
* REST API with Swagger for SaaS exposure
* PWA-enabled frontend + upload UI
* Stripe/Razorpay integration for premium pipelines
